## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry point of the application, should initialize the TypingPractice class and handle user interactions.']
- ['user.py', 'Contains the User class. This class should be implemented first as it is used by other classes.']
- ['session.py', 'Contains the Session class. This class depends on the User class.']
- ['typing_practice.py', 'Contains the TypingPractice class. This class depends on both the User and Session classes.']

## Task list

- user.py
- session.py
- typing_practice.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'user.py' contains the User class which has methods to record a session and get user's statistics.
        'session.py' contains the Session class which has methods to start and end a session and calculate typing statistics.
        'typing_practice.py' contains the TypingPractice class which uses the User and Session classes to manage the application flow.
